## 🎮 Running the App

Additionally, to compile and run your Android application locally, follow these steps using Android Studio:

1. Open your project in Android Studio.

2. Ensure all dependencies are correctly configured.

3. Click the "Build" button to compile your application.

4. Once the build is complete, select an emulator or connect a physical device.

5. Click the "Run" button to execute the application on the emulator or device.

Please note that these steps assume you have already set up your development environment correctly and that your application is error-free. Enjoy building and running your application in Android Studio!

## 📄 Compiling the Report

If you want to compile the report on Overleaf instead of doing it on your local machine, you can follow these steps:

1. Open your project in Overleaf (make sure you have created an account on Overleaf and imported your project there).

2. Locate the "primerSprint.tex" file in the project in Overleaf.

3. Click on the "primerSprint.tex" file to open it in the Overleaf editor.

4. At the top of the editor, you will see a button called "Recompile" or "Compile" (it may vary depending on the version of Overleaf). Click on this button.

5. Overleaf will automatically compile the LaTeX document and generate the corresponding PDF file.

6. Once the compilation is complete, you can download the resulting PDF file from the Overleaf interface.
